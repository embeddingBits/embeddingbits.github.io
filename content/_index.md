- I'm a supporter of FOSS and aim to contribute to open source as much as possible.  
- I contribute to projects in domains like Embedded Systems, Computer Networks, Linux Kernel, and other systems programming projects.  
- I write blogs on topics like Embedded Systems, System Design, Low-Level Programming, and Computer Networks.  
- I'm a classical pianist and a diehard fan of Chopin, particularly his melancholic works.  
- I also like to rice my [Arch Config](https://github.com/embeddingbits/arch_dotfiles).

Iâ€™m very enthusiastic about Embedded Systems, System Design, Low-Level Programming, Systems Programming, and VLSI.  
I work extensively with bare-metal programming, device drivers, and Linux-related projects such as building shells, display managers, window managers, and more.  
Iâ€™m learning Verilog and RTL simulation, and Iâ€™ve simulated a simple 4-bit processor for fun.  
I have intermediate knowledge of X11, and Iâ€™m currently learning Wayland to contribute to RiverWM.  
Building CLIs is one of my obsessions.  

I primarily work in the domains of Embedded Systems and Operating Systems using languages like C, C++, Go, and Zig.

Languages:  
`C`, `Zig`, `Golang`, `C++`, `Java`, `Python`, `Bash`, `Fish Shell`, `Verilog`, `Assembly (ARM, RISC-V)`

Misc:  
`Embedded Systems`, `Operating Systems`, `VLSI`, `Computer Networks`
