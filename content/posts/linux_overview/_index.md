# What is Linux and Why Linux?

Did you know Linux powers **90% of the world’s supercomputers** and most of the internet’s servers?
But have you ever thought about using it as your **daily driver**?

Welcome to this blog!
In this post, I’ll be discussing **Linux** and why it’s better to daily-drive a Linux system.

---

## What is Linux?

Linux is an **Operating System** (or more precisely, a **Kernel**) based on **Unix-like** systems, created by **Linus Torvalds in 1991**.
It is **open-source** and has huge use cases in the world of technology.

A **kernel** is a set of rules that instructs computer hardware to follow specific protocols, acting as a **bridge between hardware and software**.

The **Linux kernel** is primarily written in **C**, with some parts being rewritten in **Rust** for improved safety and performance.

---

## Why is it a better option to daily-drive Linux?

Linux is a **lightweight** operating system that typically uses **1.5–2.5 GB of RAM**, making it ideal for older laptops and PCs.
In comparison, **Windows** consumes **5–6 GB on average**.

Linux is **faster than Windows** by a wide margin, in nearly every situation.

Since Linux is a **kernel**, its source code is used to create many **distributions** (distros). Each distro serves general and specific purposes.

### Examples of Linux Distributions

1. **Mint Linux** – Stable and beginner-friendly.
2. **Ubuntu** – Good for both beginners and servers.
3. **Fedora** – User-friendly and cutting-edge.
4. **Arch Linux** – DIY distro for intermediate to advanced users.

There are hundreds of Linux distributions to choose from!

### 🛡️ Security and Privacy

* Linux’s **open-source nature** means vulnerabilities are quickly found and patched by the community.
* Proprietary systems like Windows have **less transparency** and may include **hidden backdoors**.
* Due to its lower market share, **malware targeting Linux** is extremely rare.

---

### 💰 Cost Efficiency

Most popular Linux distros are **completely free**, unlike Windows which costs around ₹12,000 ($139).
All Linux updates — whether **kernel**, **desktop environment**, or **system-level** — are free.

---

### 🎨 Customizability

Linux is **highly customizable** compared to proprietary operating systems.
You can choose from many **Desktop Environments (DEs)** and **Window Managers (WMs)** depending on your workflow.

**Examples:**

* DEs: GNOME, KDE Plasma, XFCE, Sway
* WMs: Hyprland, i3, AwesomeWM, DWM, BSPWM

#### My Setup

| Hyprland (WM)                               | KDE Plasma (DE) |
| ------------------------------------------- | --------------- |

These are my personal Linux configurations — **Hyprland** on the left and **KDE Plasma** on the right.

Linux allows you to **fully customize** your workflow and make your desktop **visually pleasing**.

### Software Availability

Contrary to popular belief, Linux doesn’t lack software — it has **more options** than most think.

**Package Managers by Family:**

* `apt` – Debian-based (Debian, Ubuntu, Pop!_OS, Kali)
* `dnf` / `yum` – Red Hat-based (Fedora, CentOS, RHEL)
* `pacman` – Arch-based (fast and efficient)

**Open Source Alternatives:**

* Office Suites → **OnlyOffice**, **LibreOffice**, **OpenOffice**
* Graphics Design → **GIMP** (instead of Photoshop)
* Code Editors → **Vim**, **Neovim**, **Emacs**, **Nano**, **VSCodium**

Using Linux exposes you to the **FOSS ecosystem**, strengthening open-source awareness and collaboration.

### ⚙️ Performance and Stability

Linux is known for its **performance and efficiency**, largely due to minimal bloatware.

**Key Advantages:**

* **Minimal Resource Usage:** Low background memory usage.
* **No Forced Updates:** You control updates — even after 15 years, it will still work fine.

#### LTS Distributions and Kernels

**LTS** = *Long Term Support*.
Some Linux versions are maintained for years with guaranteed stability and updates.

* **Ubuntu LTS:** 5 years of security support.
* **Debian Stable:** Known for rock-solid long-term reliability.

There are also **LTS kernel versions** that ensure stable driver and security updates.

---

### Enhanced Productivity and Use Cases

Linux boosts productivity due to its **speed and command-line efficiency**.
While it supports great GUIs, many users eventually prefer using the **terminal** for faster workflows.

* **90% of Internet servers** run Linux because of its **stability and scalability**.
* Cybersecurity professionals prefer Linux since most tools run better here.
* Linux proficiency is a **valuable skill** during technical interviews.

## Common Myths About Linux

### Myth 1: Linux is only for tech geeks

Not true!
Linux can be used for general purposes. The terminal is not mandatory — it’s just powerful.
You can browse the web, use apps, and enjoy a normal desktop experience.

Beginner-friendly distros include:

* [Ubuntu](https://ubuntu.com/download/desktop)
* [Fedora](https://fedoraproject.org/workstation/download)

### Myth 2: It’s hard to install software or use browsers

False again.
Package managers make installing software much easier than Windows.
And yes — you can use browsers like Chrome, Firefox, Brave, etc. just as usual.

---

## Getting Started with Linux

Try these **beginner-friendly distros**:

* [Linux Mint](https://www.linuxmint.com/download.php) — Highly recommended
* [Ubuntu](https://ubuntu.com/download/desktop)
* [Fedora](https://fedoraproject.org/workstation/download)

## Bottom Note

Linux is more than an operating system — it’s a **philosophy of freedom, efficiency, and empowerment**.
With its vast software library, security, performance, and endless customization, Linux is a **powerful alternative** to traditional systems.

Transitioning might seem unfamiliar at first, but with its **community support** and **intuitive interfaces**, it’s an enjoyable learning journey.

By adopting Linux, you’re not just choosing an OS — you’re **joining a global movement** built on collaboration and innovation.

So, why not give Linux a try?
You might just discover a **new way of computing**.
