Hi, I’m Amiitesh — an open-source enthusiast and passionate Linux and Neovim user. I love working at the intersection of Embedded Systems, Hardware Optimisation, and Low-Level Programming and VLSI.

I contribute to projects across Embedded Systems, Computer Networks, and Systems Programming, and I’m currently diving deeper into Wayland and VLSI design. I enjoy crafting command-line tools and experimenting with C, Zig, C++, Golang and Verilog.

Outside tech, I’m a classical pianist and a diehard fan of Chopin's repertoire.
