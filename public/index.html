Iâ€™m a supporter of FOSS and aim to contribute to open source as much as possible. I contribute to projects in domains like Embedded Systems, Computer Networks, Linux Kernel, and other systems programming projects. I write blogs on topics like Embedded Systems, System Design, Low-Level Programming, and Computer Networks. Iâ€™m a classical pianist and a diehard fan of Chopin, particularly his melancholic works. I also like to rice my Arch Config. ðŸ§° ls ~/skills Iâ€™m very enthusiastic about Embedded Systems, System Design, Low-Level Programming, Systems Programming, and VLSI.
I work extensively with bare-metal programming, device drivers, and Linux-related projects such as building shells, display managers, window managers, and more.
Iâ€™m learning Verilog and RTL simulation, and Iâ€™ve simulated a simple 4-bit processor for fun.
I have intermediate knowledge of X11, and Iâ€™m currently learning Wayland to contribute to RiverWM.
Building CLIs is one of my obsessions.">
